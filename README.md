# Unity Solar System 3D 🪐🌍

A 3D interactive model of the solar system, developed in Unity with C#. This project was created to explore the possibilities of 3D modeling, VR environments, and scripting using Unity. The planets dynamically orbit the sun and rotate on their axes, providing an immersive space simulation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a school assignment, with the goal of creating a functional and aesthetic 3D model of the solar system. The focus was on learning how to use Unity for 3D scene creation, integrating textures, controlling objects via C# scripts, and building immersive environments with skyboxes.

The solar system model includes all eight planets, each with realistic textures and rotational scripts, along with a sun represented by a textured sphere. The scene is enhanced by a space-themed skybox, providing a visually appealing background.

## 🌌 Features

- **Dynamic Planetary Motion**: Each planet orbits the sun and rotates on its own axis. The rotation speed is based on real-world angular velocities.
- **Realistic Textures**: Custom textures for the sun and planets provide a detailed and accurate visual representation.
- **Immersive Skybox**: A space-themed skybox, downloaded from Unity's Asset Store, enhances the visual immersion of the solar system.
- **Custom Camera Controls**: The camera is controlled via mouse input, allowing users to freely explore the solar system with smooth, intuitive movements.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Unity 3D**
- **C# for scripting**
- **Skybox from Unity Asset Store**

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/achraf-oujjir/Unity-Solar-System-3D.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project in Unity**:
   Ensure you have Unity installed (version 2020.x or later is recommended). Open the project using Unity Hub or the Unity editor.

## 🧭 Usage

- The project simulates the solar system, with planets orbiting the sun and rotating on their axes.
- Use your mouse to control the camera's view within the solar system. The cursor is hidden to provide a more immersive experience.
- Watch as planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and others move in their respective orbits.

## 🔧 Scripts

- Planetary Rotation Scripts: C# scripts control the rotation of each planet based on its angular velocity. The script is customized for each planet and they are located in [Scripts](Assets/Scripts) directory.

- Camera Control Script: [Camera_Control.cs](Assets/Scripts/Camera_Control.cs) allows the camera to be controlled via mouse input, giving users freedom to explore the solar system. The script is attached to the Main Camera object.
